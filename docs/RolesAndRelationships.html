<h1 class="western">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the documentation for the permission system used by the
Webapp framework (and particularly the SAFE). The permission system
is handled by the SessionService object returned by the AppContext.</p>
<h1 class="western">Roles</h1>
<p>A <i>role</i>< is the simplest of
the permission states. It is a named global capability that can be
assigned to a user or a login session. In a web-context roles <i>may</i>
be inherited from the Servlet framework. In this case the role only
applies to the current logged in session. In all other cases roles
are defined in terms of an AppUser (These are ther objects/records
that represent registered users of the application). The mapping
between users and roles are stored in the <b>role_table
</b> database
table. There is a standard form that allows a users assigned roles to
be changed.  The
list of roles available to this form can be extended by adding names
to a comma separated list stored in the 
<b>role_list</b>
 configuration parameter.</p>
<p>In
practice the number of different roles checked by the application can
be very large to allow fine-tuning of permissions. However roles that
are actively assigned to users may be meta-roles that represent a
number of underlying permissions. An underlying role can be mapped to
a meta-role by setting a config parameter:
<br>
<code>
 <b>use_role.</b><i>role-name</i>=<i>meta-role-list</i>
 </code>
 <br>
 Where role-list is a comma separated list of meta-roles that inherit the permissions of the underlying role. 
</p>
<p>Some roles can be
marked at &ldquo;togglable&rdquo; roles. These roles are not active
by default and a user with access to them needs to perform an action
(such as clicking a web-menu) to enable the role before use. These
are intended for administrative roles where the user may also want to
view the application as an unprivileged user.
The set of togglable roles is defined in the <b>toggle_roles</b> configuration parameter.
</p>
<h1 class="western">Relationships</h1>
<p>Relationships are similar to roles in that they are named
capabilities. However they define a relationship with a particular
domain object (such as manager or owner)</p>

Relationships are configured via the <b> ConfigService</b> by setting:
 <b>use_relationship.<em>factory-tag</em>.<em>role</em></b>
  If this is a comma separated list it implies an OR of the component parts.
  within this AND combinations can be specified as <b>+</b> separated terms.
  <p>
  The factory (or its <b> Composite</b>s) can implement <b>AccessRoleProvider</b> to provide roles.
  <p>
  Roles of the form <i>field</i><b>-></b><i>remote_role</i> denotes a remote filter
  joined via the reference field <i>field</i> A person has these roles with the target object
  if they have the <i>remote_role</i> on the object the target references. The remote role must be unqualified.
  <p>
  Role names containing a period are qualified names the qualifier can be:
  <ul>
  <li> <b>global</b> the role is a global role not a relationship.</li>
  <li> <b>boolean</b> Use a boolean filter so all/none relationships match.</li>
  <li> <em>factory-tag</em> un-modified role from factory or a named filter from
  a <b> NamedFilterWrapper</b> wrapping the factory.
  <li> The tag of a <b> RelationshipProvider</b> for the target.</li>
  <li> The tag of a <b> AccessRoleProvider</b></li>
  </ul>
