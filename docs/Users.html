<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Every user in the application has an
entry in the <b>person</b> table that holds their details. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In the normal configuration users
self-register with the application (a process that verifies the users
email address) and authenticates using a password. The application
supports password change and recovery via email. It is also possible
to enable alternative web-based login mechanisms such as
Shibboleth/UKAMF. These mechanisms are typically implemented in the
apache httpd front-end.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If all potential users are known to be
able to use an external authenticator it is also possible to
configure the application to only use an external web-based
authentication.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Access to additional permissions within
the application is granted by a set of roles stored in the <b>role_table</b>
database table. Key roles include:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Admin</b>
	which gives access to the internal administration forms (The first
	user to register with a new application instance is usually given
	this role automatically unless you disable the
	<i>service.feature.bootstrap.admin</i> feature).</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Developer</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">this
	gives access to additional very low-level (and dangerous) functions
	like setting additional configuration properties or modifying the
	database tables.</span></p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">Both of the above
are usually set as &ldquo;toggleable-roles&rdquo; which can be
explicitly turned on and off during a user session.</p>
