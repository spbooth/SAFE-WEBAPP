/** classes and interfaces that define transitions.
 * 
 * Transitions are a framework for defining form based logic on target types. 
 * Transitions use standard jsp and servlets so new transition logic can be added 
 * entirely in java.
 * This is the preferred route to add form based logic to an application.
