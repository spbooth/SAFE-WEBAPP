accessability.issues.multiinput=Some form elements (specifically complex elements that utilise multiple html inputs) may work poorly with screen readers as only the first input will be referenced by the form label.
accessability.issues.dynamic_text=Much of the content is dynamically generated, Dynamically generated content may be overly wide and re-flow poorly at high magnification.
accessability.issues.dynamic_graphs=Dynamically generated graphs will not have useful alternative text (though we try to ensure that the same information is also available in tabular form).
