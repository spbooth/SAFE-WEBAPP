                 This is the WEBAPP framework.

It is a collection of common support code developed at EPCC and used 
for: 
* Grid-SAFE
* SAFE
* and a number of internal tools and projects.

Dependencies are mostly managed via ivy. The ivysettings.xml file points to our local development repository
you can remove this file to resolve against the default repositories but You will have to 
Download Chart2D explicitly from http://chart2d.sourceforge.net/ (and remove it from ivy.xml) 
as it is not in public repositories.
