This directory contains generic script fragments for use in
any application using the common webapp framework. In particular to ecapsulate dependencies between
jsp pages and the re-usable servlets.

These are often jsf files included in jsp pages rather than full pages
in themselves.

Because these files are shared between multiple applications it is good practice to use 2 levels of 
redirection for key files 
e.g. a top-level include file that includes the version from the scripts directory version.
This makes it easier to override or extend for specific applications.
